# Synopsis

``` javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
var tough = require('tough-cookie');
=======
var tough = require('tough-cookie'); // note: not 'cookie', 'cookies' or 'node-cookie'
>>>>>>> origin/master
var Cookie = tough.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) {
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
});
```

# Installation

It's _so_ easy!

`npm install tough-cookie`

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Requires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.

>>>>>>> origin/master
Why the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.

# API

<<<<<<< HEAD
## tough

Functions on the module you get from `require('tough-cookie')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don't need to be "bound".

**Note**: prior to 1.0.x, several of these functions took a `strict` parameter. This has since been removed from the API as it was no longer necessary.

### `parseDate(string)`

Parse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.

### `formatDate(date)`

Format a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).

### `canonicalDomain(str)`

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

### `domainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])`
=======
tough
=====

Functions on the module you get from `require('tough-cookie')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don't need to be "bound".

parseDate(string[,strict])
-----------------

Parse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).

formatDate(date)
----------------

Format a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).

canonicalDomain(str)
--------------------

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

domainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])
-------------------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Answers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".

The `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `defaultPath(path)`
=======
defaultPath(path)
-----------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Given a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.

The `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `pathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)`
=======
pathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)
-----------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Answers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.

This is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `parse(header)`

alias for `Cookie.parse(header)`

### `fromJSON(string)`

alias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`

### `getPublicSuffix(hostname)`
=======
parse(header[,strict=false])
----------------------------

alias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`

fromJSON(string)
----------------

alias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`

getPublicSuffix(hostname)
-------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Returns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.

For example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.

For further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `cookieCompare(a,b)`

For use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:

* Longest `.path`
* oldest `.creation` (which has a 1ms precision, same as `Date`)
* lowest `.creationIndex` (to get beyond the 1ms precision)
=======
cookieCompare(a,b)
------------------

For use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.
>>>>>>> origin/master

``` javascript
var cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];
cookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Note**: Since JavaScript's `Date` is limited to a 1ms precision, cookies within the same milisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`. This preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for `MemoryCookieStore`, since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but may not be so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated `Store`s may wish to set this to some other _logical clock_ such that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably _shouldn't_ do, it's stored in `Cookie.cookiesCreated`.

### `permuteDomain(domain)`

Generates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

### `permutePath(path)`

Generates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.


## Cookie

Exported via `tough.Cookie`.

### `Cookie.parse(header)`

Parses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.
=======
permuteDomain(domain)
---------------------

Generates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.


permutePath(path)
-----------------

Generates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

Cookie
======

Cookie.parse(header[,strict=false])
-----------------------------------

Parses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn't follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.
>>>>>>> origin/master

Here's how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:

``` javascript
if (res.headers['set-cookie'] instanceof Array)
  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });
else
  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])];
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Properties

Cookie object properties:
=======
Cookie.fromJSON(string)
-----------------------

Convert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.

Properties
==========
>>>>>>> origin/master

  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")
  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")
  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`
  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`
  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie
  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie
  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag
  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag
  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * _creation_ - `Date` - when this cookie was constructed
  * _creationIndex_ - number - set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (please see `cookieCompare(a,b)` for a full explanation)
=======
>>>>>>> origin/master

After a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:

  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)
  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * _creation_ - `Date` - **modified** from construction to when the cookie was added to the jar
  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.

### `Cookie([{properties}])`

Receives an options object that can contain any of the above Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.

### `.toString()`

encode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.

### `.cookieString()`

encode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with '=').

### `.setExpires(String)`

sets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.

### `.setMaxAge(number)`

sets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.

### `.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])`

### `.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])`

expiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.

Max-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.creation` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.
=======
  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar
  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.

Construction([{options}])
------------

Receives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.

.toString()
-----------

encode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.

.cookieString()
---------------

encode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with '=').

.setExpires(String)
-------------------

sets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.

.setMaxAge(number)
-------------------

sets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.

.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])
-----------------------------

.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])
-----------------------------

expiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.

Max-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.
>>>>>>> origin/master

If Expires (`.expires`) is set, that's returned.

Otherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `.TTL([now=Date.now()])`
=======
.TTL([now=Date.now()])
---------
>>>>>>> origin/master

compute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.

The "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `.canonicalizedDoman()`

### `.cdomain()`

return the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.

### `.toJSON()`

For convenience in using `JSON.serialize(cookie)`. Returns a plain-old `Object` that can be JSON-serialized.

Any `Date` properties (i.e., `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are exported in ISO format (`.toISOString()`).

**NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties will be discarded. In tough-cookie 1.x, since there was no `.toJSON` method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.

### `Cookie.fromJSON(strOrObj)`

Does the reverse of `cookie.toJSON()`. If passed a string, will `JSON.parse()` that first.

Any `Date` properties (i.e., `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are parsed via `Date.parse()`, not the tough-cookie `parseDate`, since it's JavaScript/JSON-y timestamps being handled at this layer.

Returns `null` upon JSON parsing error.

### `.clone()`

Does a deep clone of this cookie, exactly implemented as `Cookie.fromJSON(cookie.toJSON())`.

### `.validate()`
=======
.canonicalizedDoman()
---------------------

.cdomain()
----------

return the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.

.validate()
-----------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Status: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.

validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:

``` javascript
if (cookie.validate() === true) {
  // it's tasty
} else {
  // yuck!
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD

## CookieJar

Exported via `tough.CookieJar`.

### `CookieJar([store],[rejectPublicSuffixes])`

Simply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you'd like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.

### Properties

CookieJar object properties:
=======
CookieJar
=========

Construction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])
------------

Simply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you'd like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.


Attributes
----------
>>>>>>> origin/master

  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)

Since eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))`

Attempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.creation`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.
=======
.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Attempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.
>>>>>>> origin/master

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  `Store` errors aren't ignored by this option.

As per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).

### `.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])`

Synchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))`
=======
  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks
  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren't ignored by this option.

As per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).

.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])
-------------------------------------------------------

Synchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))
-------------------------------------------------

__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below

.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))
-----------------------------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Retrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.

If an error is encountered, that's passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the underlying store (the default `MemoryCookieStore` supports it).

The `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.

### `.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])`

Synchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getCookieString(...)`

Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.

### `.getCookieStringSync(...)`

Synchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getSetCookieStrings(...)`

Returns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.

### `.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)`

Synchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.serialize(cb(err,serializedObject))`

Serialize the Jar if the underlying store supports `.getAllCookies`.

**NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties will be discarded. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.

See [Serialization Format].

### `.serializeSync()`

Sync version of .serialize

### `.toJSON()`

Alias of .serializeSync() for the convenience of `JSON.stringify(cookiejar)`.

### `CookieJar.deserialize(serialized, [store], cb(err,object))`

A new Jar is created and the serialized Cookies are added to the underlying store. Each `Cookie` is added via `store.putCookie` in the order in which they appear in the serialization.

The `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created.

As a convenience, if `serialized` is a string, it is passed through `JSON.parse` first. If that throws an error, this is passed to the callback.

### `CookieJar.deserializeSync(serialized, [store])`

Sync version of `.deserialize`.  _Note_ that the `store` must be synchronous for this to work.

### `CookieJar.fromJSON(string)`

Alias of `.deserializeSync` to provide consistency with `Cookie.fromJSON()`.

### `.clone([store,]cb(err,newJar))`

Produces a deep clone of this jar. Modifications to the original won't affect the clone, and vice versa.

The `store` argument is optional, but should be an instance of `Store`. By default, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is created. Transferring between store types is supported so long as the source implements `.getAllCookies()` and the destination implements `.putCookie()`.

### `.cloneSync([store])`

Synchronous version of `.clone`, returning a new `CookieJar` instance.

The `store` argument is optional, but must be a _synchronous_ `Store` instance if specified. If not passed, a new instance of `MemoryCookieStore` is used.

The _source_ and _destination_ must both be synchronous `Store`s. If one or both stores are asynchronous, use `.clone` instead. Recall that `MemoryCookieStore` supports both synchronous and asynchronous API calls.

## Store

Base class for CookieJar stores. Available as `tough.Store`.

## Store API

The storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.

Stores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require('tough-cookie').Store`.

Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set to `true`, then the `*Sync` methods on the of the containing `CookieJar` can be used (however, the continuation-passing style
=======
  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).

The `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.

.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])
----------------------------------------

Synchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

.getCookieString(...)
---------------------

Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.

.getCookieStringSync(...)
-------------------------

Synchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

.getSetCookieStrings(...)
-------------------------

Returns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.

.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)
-----------------------------

Synchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

Store
=====

Base class for CookieJar stores.

# CookieStore API

The storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.

Stores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require('tough-cookie').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.
>>>>>>> origin/master

All `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.

The Cookie store must have all of the following methods.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))`
=======
store.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))
---------------------------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Retrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.

Callback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))`
=======
store.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))
------------------------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Locates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.

If no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.

The resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it's OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.

As of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))`
=======
store.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))
--------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Adds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it's possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.

The `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.

Pass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))`

Update an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.

The `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects (to the precision possible via JavaScript's clock).  Both `.creation` and `.creationIndex` are guaranteed to be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are selected for automatic deletion (e.g., least-recently-used, which is up to the store to implement).

store.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))
-------------------------------------------------

Update an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.

The `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).
>>>>>>> origin/master

Stores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn't define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.

The `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.

Pass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))`
=======
store.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))
----------------------------------------------
>>>>>>> origin/master

Remove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).

The implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn't exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `store.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))`

Removes matching cookies from the store.  The `path` parameter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.

Pass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.

### `store.getAllCookies(cb(err, cookies))`

Produces an `Array` of all cookies during `jar.serialize()`. The items in the array can be true `Cookie` objects or generic `Object`s with the [Serialization Format] data structure.

Cookies SHOULD be returned in creation order to preserve sorting via `compareCookies()`. For reference, `MemoryCookieStore` will sort by `.creationIndex` since it uses true `Cookie` objects internally. If you don't return the cookies in creation order, they'll still be sorted by creation time, but this only has a precision of 1ms.  See `compareCookies` for more detail.

Pass an error if retrieval fails.

## MemoryCookieStore

Inherits from `Store`.

A just-in-memory CookieJar synchronous store implementation, used by default. Despite being a synchronous implementation, it's usable with both the synchronous and asynchronous forms of the `CookieJar` API.

# Serialization Format

**NOTE**: if you want to have custom `Cookie` properties serialized, add the property name to `Cookie.serializableProperties`.

```js
  {
    // The version of tough-cookie that serialized this jar.
    version: 'tough-cookie@1.x.y',

    // add the store type, to make humans happy:
    storeType: 'MemoryCookieStore',

    // CookieJar configuration:
    rejectPublicSuffixes: true,
    // ... future items go here

    // Gets filled from jar.store.getAllCookies():
    cookies: [
      {
        key: 'string',
        value: 'string',
        // ...
        /* other Cookie.serializableProperties go here */
      }
    ]
  }
```

# TODO

  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`
    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891
  * better tests for `validate()`?
